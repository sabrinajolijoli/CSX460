## Model Objective

* What do you expect to achieve with the model?
predict the category of crimes that occurred in the city by the bay
* How will you measure its performance?
using test data to test the performance 


## Data Source(s)

* What are the data sources for the model?
From Sunsets to SOMA ,and Marina to Excelsior ,
this competition's dataset provides nearly 12 years of
 crime reports from across all of San Francisco's neighborhoods. 
* How will you obtain the data?
The data published by City and Country of San Francisco 


## Response

* What it the response variables?
dates , descript,  Dayofweek pdDistrict Resolution address longitude and latitude 

* Are there any surrogate response variables?


## Expected Features

* What are some of the feature you expect to use?

surrogate feature 


## Models

* What modeling Techniques do you plan on trying?
Regression Models
Classification Models 

* How will you compare the models
measuring Predictor Importance 

## Deployment

* Who will use the model?
Socialist and police and maybe university professor 
* How will the use it?
They can use it to 


## Miscellaneous

* What do you expect to learn from this Project?
how to use the modeling function I learned to predict the things I am interested.
